We can win the race
We can win the race
We have a dream, you win tonight
Take a chance, take a chance, God is on you side
We pray for you, you like a hurricane
You can win, you can win, you can win the game
Try the impossible, we want a miracle
There's a million fans around
Our dreams free, we want the victory
The hero's back in town

We have a dream, we don't give up
We can win, we can win, right from the start
The price is high, time is on your side
Take the chance, take the chance, you'll win tonight
You know you are the best, you can beat the rest
We never let you down,
You have the energy, we want the victory
The hero's back in town
