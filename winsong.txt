We can win the race
We can win the race
We have a dream, you win tonight
Take a chance, take a chance, God is on you side
We pray for you, you like a hurricane
You can win, you can win, you can win the game
Try the impossible, we want a miracle
There's a million fans around
Our dreams free, we want the victory
The hero's back in town
