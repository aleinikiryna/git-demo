Don't hold your breath
Like I'm not scared
Like I want you to trust me
Don't waste your time

<<<<<<< HEAD
But it's the same old situation
We made it through this far. Oh.
We watched the rockets kiss the sky.
I saw the flames burn out in your eyes.

The things we never say
Are better often left alone.

Nothing that I do
Will ever be enough for you
Whatever I do, whatever I do.
Take me as I am
I'll never be the other man.
Forget about you
I'll forget about this time.
